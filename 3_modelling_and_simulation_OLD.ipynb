    "\n",
    "For a given model, the idea will be to simulate the model as if it were deployed at the beginning of last season. In other words, for every gameweek in the season, the model will make predictions (as if we were \"in that gameweek\") for that gameweek and ensuing gameweeks. But, what will this look like in practice? Let's give an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Simulating Gameweek *N***\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we're in Gameweek *N* last season. That is, Gameweeks *1, 2, ... , N-1* have happened and Gameweek *N* is about to be played. Then, \n",
    "* The model will be **trained** on Gameweeks *1, 2, ... , N-1* (i.e. Gameweeks *1, 2, ... , N-1* will form the training data).\n",
    "* And the model will **predict** Gameweeks *N, N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4* (i.e. Gameweeks *N, N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4* will form the test data).\n",
    "\n",
    "for *N* between *3, 4, ... , 38*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*A couple of things to note...* \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Why 5?:** It should be noted, that the model always makes predictions for the next 5 gameweeks. But why 5? My thinking here is that, in practice, a model which predicts for just the next gameweek is not that useful. Conversely, a model which makes predictions for *lots and lots* gameweeks ahead of time might start to make inaccurate estimates. Therefore, for now, I think 5 serves as a 'happy medium'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **What about Gameweeks (GWs) 1 and 2?:** You may have noticed that we will not make predictions for GWs 1 and 2. I've chosen to exclude making predictions for these GWs for a few reasons:\n",
    "* By **GW1** (and by design) all predictor variables will be null (Recall: the predictor variables reflect data observed *before* the start of the given GW).\n",
    "* By **GW2** (and by the same design) we will still not have observed a \"full\" Gameweek. Yes, we will have seen points scored in GW1. However, the predictor variables for GW1 will still be null.\n",
    "* For now, I think **it is acceptable to not make predictions for these Gameweeks**. I think this is ok because our models will still \"work\" (that is - make predictions) for 36 out of the 38 Gameweeks in the season. However, of course, this is something which should be addressed in a future iteration of the project...\n",

What should I do](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/oh_no_I_got_the_wrong_sign.pdf) for more), I've decided to continue with the variables proposed by both of the above algorithms. There is a multitude of reasons which perhaps explain why this variable has the opposite sign than expected, and therefore, I think this is best left for future investigation. "

Here's a couple reasons why I think teams may have rotated their Forwards/Midfielders around this period:\n",
    "    1. **Double Gameweeks:** GWs 24 and 25 were \"double gameweeks\", i.e. some teams had two games within one gameweek. And it's common knowledge that fixture congestion can lead to squad rotation.\n",
    "    2. **Champions League/Europa League:** Around GW25 began the knockout stages in the Champions League and the Europa League which again likely led to lots of unexpected squad rotation. In fact, 7 Premier League teams played in these knockout games (Man City, Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Spurs and Leicester) which you might expect to have exacerbated the impact.\n",
    "    3. **Why Forwards and Midfielders?:** Notice predictive accuracy for Goalkeepers and Defenders *did not worsen* as we saw for Forwards and Midfielders around the same period. I would argue this supports my hypothesis since we know Forwards/Midfielders tend to be rotated more than Goalkeepers/Defenders. \n",

The search strategy does this by an iterative procedure known as \"halving\". Basically, what happens here is different settings(/canditates) are tested using a small amount of data. The best candidates then are tested using more and more data until a best candidate is found. The benefit of using HalvingGridSearchCV is that is **much faster**  than GridSearchCV, which is crucial since this makes the methodology practical.\n"

Hence, I tried using **SHAP values** instead as a method for feature attribution.\n",

I'm aware that this is not 'best practice' as problems like this are akin to those frequently seen in industry; however, for my own personal development, I want to learn more about how we actually deploy ML algorithms in the real-world as well as researching them which is what we have done up until now."
