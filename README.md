## Background and Motivation

### What is Fantasy Football, and how does it work?

Fantasy Football is a game, which is closely related to actual Football.  

In a nutshell, you buy players for your team - which correspond to real professional footballers – who score points, with the overarching goal to **maximise the number of points** your team has by the end of the season. Given that points are directly related to real-world football events, predictive tools become an invaluable asset for FPL managers.

### What was the purpose of the project?

In 2021, during my university placement year, I began my data science journey in the role of a Data Analyst. This experience inspired me to start this side project, one of my first deep dives into the space. From this project, I gained invaluable lessons that have since influenced my approach and understanding in the field.
