# Fantasy Premier League Points Predictor

A Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points prediction tool to help FPL managers make better data driven decisions. This project demonstrates how such a tool could be developed and, more importantly, improved in the future.

Suppose you're looking for a budget Forward in the £5.0m-£6.5m price range to improve your team, but you're not sure where to begin. Using the tool created, you can obtain quick, reliable point projections to help make your decision.

## Background and Motivation

### What is Fantasy Football, and how does it work?

Fantasy Football is a game, which is closely related to actual Football.  

In a nutshell, you buy players - which correspond to real professional Footballers – who score points. The objective is for you to **maximise the number of points** your team has, by the end of the season. Players and points both correspond to what happens in professional Football.

Therefore, people who play Fantasy Football benefit from forecasts about which players are going to score points. 

### What was the purpose of the project?

I completed this project during my university placement year (2021), outside of office hours. On placement, I worked as a Data Analyst, where I predominantly worked on a on large clustering project, which was the first ever data science project I worked on. I loved how much I was learning at work; however, I still felt that I was only scratching the surface of data science. **To learn more about data science**, therefore, I decided to start my own project, namely the Fantasy Football Points Prediction project. 

I can confidently say that I learned so much from designing and running my own personal project. I won’t write a list, but today I still regularly find myself benefitting from the things I learned during the Fantasy Football project. In that sense, because of what I learned during the project, the project was a success.
